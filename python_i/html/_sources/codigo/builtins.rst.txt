               ``abs``\ (\ *x*\ )\ `¶ <#abs>`__
                  Return the absolute value of a number. The argument
                  may be an integer, a floating point number, or an
                  object implementing ``__abs__()``. If the argument is
                  a complex number, its magnitude is returned.

               ``aiter``\ (\ *async_iterable*\ )\ `¶ <#aiter>`__
                  Return an `asynchronous
                  iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator>`__
                  for an `asynchronous
                  iterable <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterable>`__.
                  Equivalent to calling ``x.__aiter__()``.

                  Note: Unlike ```iter()`` <#iter>`__,
                  ```aiter()`` <#aiter>`__ has no 2-argument variant.

               ``all``\ (\ *iterable*\ )\ `¶ <#all>`__
                  Return ``True`` if all elements of the *iterable* are
                  true (or if the iterable is empty). Equivalent to:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                                   if not element:
                                       return False
                               return True

               *awaitable* ``anext``\ (\ *async_iterator*\ [, *default*\ ])\ `¶ <#anext>`__
                  When awaited, return the next item from the given
                  `asynchronous
                  iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator>`__,
                  or *default* if given and the iterator is exhausted.

                  This is the async variant of the
                  ```next()`` <#next>`__ builtin, and behaves similarly.

                  This calls the
                  ```__anext__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__anext__>`__
                  method of *async_iterator*, returning an
                  `awaitable <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-awaitable>`__.
                  Awaiting this returns the next value of the iterator.
                  If *default* is given, it is returned if the iterator
                  is exhausted, otherwise
                  ```StopAsyncIteration`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration>`__
                  is raised.

                     New in version 3.10.

               ``any``\ (\ *iterable*\ )\ `¶ <#any>`__
                  Return ``True`` if any element of the *iterable* is
                  true. If the iterable is empty, return ``False``.
                  Equivalent to:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           def any(iterable):
                               for element in iterable:
                                   if element:
                                       return True
                               return False

               ``ascii``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#ascii>`__
                  As ```repr()`` <#repr>`__, return a string containing
                  a printable representation of an object, but escape
                  the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by
                  ```repr()`` <#repr>`__ using ``\x``, ``\u``, or ``\U``
                  escapes. This generates a string similar to that
                  returned by ```repr()`` <#repr>`__ in Python 2.

               ``bin``\ (\ *x*\ )\ `¶ <#bin>`__
                  Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed
                  with “0b”. The result is a valid Python expression. If
                  *x* is not a Python ```int`` <#int>`__ object, it has
                  to define an ``__index__()`` method that returns an
                  integer. Some examples:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> bin(3)
                           '0b11'
                           >>> bin(-10)
                           '-0b1010'

                  If the prefix “0b” is desired or not, you can use
                  either of the following ways.

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> format(14, '#b'), format(14, 'b')
                           ('0b1110', '1110')
                           >>> f'{14:#b}', f'{14:b}'
                           ('0b1110', '1110')

                  See also ```format()`` <#format>`__ for more
                  information.

               *class* ``bool``\ ([\ *x*\ ])\ `¶ <#bool>`__
                  Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of ``True`` or
                  ``False``. *x* is converted using the standard `truth
                  testing
                  procedure <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth>`__.
                  If *x* is false or omitted, this returns ``False``;
                  otherwise, it returns ``True``. The
                  ```bool`` <#bool>`__ class is a subclass of
                  ```int`` <#int>`__ (see `Numeric Types — int, float,
                  complex <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>`__).
                  It cannot be subclassed further. Its only instances
                  are ``False`` and ``True`` (see `Boolean
                  Values <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-boolean-values>`__).

                     positional-only parameter.

               ``breakpoint``\ (\ *\*args*, *\*\*kws*\ )\ `¶ <#breakpoint>`__
                  This function drops you into the debugger at the call
                  site. Specifically, it calls
                  ```sys.breakpointhook()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.breakpointhook>`__,
                  passing ``args`` and ``kws`` straight through. By
                  default, ``sys.breakpointhook()`` calls
                  ```pdb.set_trace()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace>`__
                  expecting no arguments. In this case, it is purely a
                  convenience function so you don’t have to explicitly
                  import
                  ```pdb`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#module-pdb>`__
                  or type as much code to enter the debugger. However,
                  ```sys.breakpointhook()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.breakpointhook>`__
                  can be set to some other function and
                  ```breakpoint()`` <#breakpoint>`__ will automatically
                  call that, allowing you to drop into the debugger of
                  choice.

                  Raises an `auditing
                  event <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing>`__
                  ``builtins.breakpoint`` with argument
                  ``breakpointhook``.

                  Return a new array of bytes. The
                  ```bytearray`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray>`__
                  class is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0
                  <= x < 256. It has most of the usual methods of
                  mutable sequences, described in `Mutable Sequence
                  Types <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable>`__,
                  as well as most methods that the
                  ```bytes`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes>`__
                  type has, see `Bytes and Bytearray
                  Operations <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-methods>`__.

                  The optional *source* parameter can be used to
                  initialize the array in a few different ways:

                  -  If it is a *string*, you must also give the
                     *encoding* (and optionally, *errors*) parameters;
                     ```bytearray()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray>`__
                     then converts the string to bytes using
                     ```str.encode()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode>`__.

                  -  If it is an *integer*, the array will have that
                     size and will be initialized with null bytes.

                  -  If it is an object conforming to the `buffer
                     interface <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects>`__,
                     a read-only buffer of the object will be used to
                     initialize the bytes array.

                  -  If it is an *iterable*, it must be an iterable of
                     integers in the range ``0 <= x < 256``, which are
                     used as the initial contents of the array.

                  Without an argument, an array of size 0 is created.

                  See also `Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray,
                  memoryview <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#binaryseq>`__
                  and `Bytearray
                  Objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typebytearray>`__.

               *class* ``bytes``\ ([\ *source*\ [, *encoding*\ [, *errors*\ ]]])
                  Return a new “bytes” object which is an immutable
                  sequence of integers in the range ``0 <= x < 256``.
                  ```bytes`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes>`__
                  is an immutable version of
                  ```bytearray`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray>`__
                  – it has the same non-mutating methods and the same
                  indexing and slicing behavior.

                  Accordingly, constructor arguments are interpreted as
                  for
                  ```bytearray()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray>`__.

                  Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see
                  `String and Bytes
                  literals <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings>`__.

                  See also `Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray,
                  memoryview <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#binaryseq>`__,
                  `Bytes
                  Objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typebytes>`__,
                  and `Bytes and Bytearray
                  Operations <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-methods>`__.

               ``callable``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#callable>`__
                  Return
                  ```True`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True>`__
                  if the *object* argument appears callable,
                  ```False`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False>`__
                  if not. If this returns ``True``, it is still possible
                  that a call fails, but if it is ``False``, calling
                  *object* will never succeed. Note that classes are
                  callable (calling a class returns a new instance);
                  instances are callable if their class has a
                  ``__call__()`` method.

                  .. container:: versionadded

                     New in version 3.2:This function was first removed
                     in Python 3.0 and then brought back in Python 3.2.

               ``chr``\ (\ *i*\ )\ `¶ <#chr>`__
                  Return the string representing a character whose
                  Unicode code point is the integer *i*. For example,
                  ``chr(97)`` returns the string ``'a'``, while
                  ``chr(8364)`` returns the string ``'€'``. This is the
                  inverse of ```ord()`` <#ord>`__.

                  The valid range for the argument is from 0 through
                  1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base 16).
                  ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                  will be raised if *i* is outside that range.

               ``@``\ ``classmethod``\ `¶ <#classmethod>`__
                  Transform a method into a class method.

                  A class method receives the class as an implicit first
                  argument, just like an instance method receives the
                  instance. To declare a class method, use this idiom:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class C:
                               @classmethod
                               def f(cls, arg1, arg2): ...

                  The ``@classmethod`` form is a function
                  `decorator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator>`__
                  – see `Function
                  definitions <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function>`__
                  for details.

                  A class method can be called either on the class (such
                  as ``C.f()``) or on an instance (such as ``C().f()``).
                  The instance is ignored except for its class. If a
                  class method is called for a derived class, the
                  derived class object is passed as the implied first
                  argument.

                  Class methods are different than C++ or Java static
                  methods. If you want those, see
                  ```staticmethod()`` <#staticmethod>`__ in this
                  section. For more information on class methods, see
                  `The standard type
                  hierarchy <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.9:Class methods can now wrap
                     other
                     `descriptors <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-descriptor>`__
                     such as ```property()`` <#property>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.10:Class methods now inherit
                     the method attributes (``__module__``,
                     ``__name__``, ``__qualname__``, ``__doc__`` and
                     ``__annotations__``) and have a new ``__wrapped__``
                     attribute.

               ``compile``\ (\ *source*, *filename*, *mode*, *flags=0*, *dont_inherit=False*, *optimize=- 1*\ )\ `¶ <#compile>`__
                  Compile the *source* into a code or AST object. Code
                  objects can be executed by ```exec()`` <#exec>`__ or
                  ```eval()`` <#eval>`__. *source* can either be a
                  normal string, a byte string, or an AST object. Refer
                  to the
                  ```ast`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#module-ast>`__
                  module documentation for information on how to work
                  with AST objects.

                  The *filename* argument should give the file from
                  which the code was read; pass some recognizable value
                  if it wasn’t read from a file (``'<string>'`` is
                  commonly used).

                  The *mode* argument specifies what kind of code must
                  be compiled; it can be ``'exec'`` if *source* consists
                  of a sequence of statements, ``'eval'`` if it consists
                  of a single expression, or ``'single'`` if it consists
                  of a single interactive statement (in the latter case,
                  expression statements that evaluate to something other
                  than ``None`` will be printed).

                  The optional arguments *flags* and *dont_inherit*
                  control which `compiler
                  options <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast-compiler-flags>`__
                  should be activated and which `future
                  features <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#future>`__
                  should be allowed. If neither is present (or both are
                  zero) the code is compiled with the same flags that
                  affect the code that is calling
                  ```compile()`` <#compile>`__. If the *flags* argument
                  is given and *dont_inherit* is not (or is zero) then
                  the compiler options and the future statements
                  specified by the *flags* argument are used in addition
                  to those that would be used anyway. If *dont_inherit*
                  is a non-zero integer then the *flags* argument is it
                  – the flags (future features and compiler options) in
                  the surrounding code are ignored.

                  Compiler options and future statements are specified
                  by bits which can be bitwise ORed together to specify
                  multiple options. The bitfield required to specify a
                  given future feature can be found as the
                  ``compiler_flag`` attribute on the ``_Feature``
                  instance in the
                  ```__future__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html#module-__future__>`__
                  module. `Compiler
                  flags <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast-compiler-flags>`__
                  can be found in
                  ```ast`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#module-ast>`__
                  module, with ``PyCF_`` prefix.

                  The argument *optimize* specifies the optimization
                  level of the compiler; the default value of ``-1``
                  selects the optimization level of the interpreter as
                  given by
                  ```-O`` <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O>`__
                  options. Explicit levels are ``0`` (no optimization;
                  ``__debug__`` is true), ``1`` (asserts are removed,
                  ``__debug__`` is false) or ``2`` (docstrings are
                  removed too).

                  This function raises
                  ```SyntaxError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError>`__
                  if the compiled source is invalid, and
                  ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                  if the source contains null bytes.

                  If you want to parse Python code into its AST
                  representation, see
                  ```ast.parse()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.parse>`__.

                  Raises an `auditing
                  event <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing>`__
                  ``compile`` with arguments ``source`` and
                  ``filename``. This event may also be raised by
                  implicit compilation.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     When compiling a string with multi-line code in
                     ``'single'`` or ``'eval'`` mode, input must be
                     terminated by at least one newline character. This
                     is to facilitate detection of incomplete and
                     complete statements in the
                     ```code`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html#module-code>`__

                     Warning

                     It is possible to crash the Python interpreter with
                     a sufficiently large/complex string when compiling
                     to an AST object due to stack depth limitations in

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.2:Allowed use of Windows and
                     Mac newlines. Also, input in ``'exec'`` mode does
                     not have to end in a newline anymore. Added the
                     *optimize* parameter.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.5:Previously,
                     ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                     was raised when null bytes were encountered in
                     *source*.

                  .. container:: versionadded

                     New in version
                     3.8:\ ``ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT`` can now be
                     passed in flags to enable support for top-level
                     ``await``, ``async for``, and ``async with``.

               *class* ``complex``\ ([\ *real*\ [, *imag*\ ]])\ `¶ <#complex>`__
                  Return a complex number with the value *real* +
                  *imag*\ \*1j or convert a string or number to a
                  complex number. If the first parameter is a string, it
                  will be interpreted as a complex number and the
                  function must be called without a second parameter.
                  The second parameter can never be a string. Each
                  argument may be any numeric type (including complex).
                  If *imag* is omitted, it defaults to zero and the
                  constructor serves as a numeric conversion like
                  ```int`` <#int>`__ and ```float`` <#float>`__. If both
                  arguments are omitted, returns ``0j``.

                  For a general Python object ``x``, ``complex(x)``
                  delegates to ``x.__complex__()``. If ``__complex__()``
                  is not defined then it falls back to ``__float__()``.
                  If ``__float__()`` is not defined then it falls back
                  to ``__index__()``.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     When converting from a string, the string must not
                     contain whitespace around the central ``+`` or
                     ``-`` operator. For example, ``complex('1+2j')`` is
                     fine, but ``complex('1 + 2j')`` raises
                     ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__.

                  The complex type is described in `Numeric Types — int,
                  float,
                  complex <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>`__.

                     Changed in version 3.6:Grouping digits with
                     underscores as in code literals is allowed.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.8:Falls back to
                     ``__index__()`` if ``__complex__()`` and
                     ``__float__()`` are not defined.

               ``delattr``\ (\ *object*, *name*\ )\ `¶ <#delattr>`__
                  This is a relative of ```setattr()`` <#setattr>`__.
                  The arguments are an object and a string. The string
                  must be the name of one of the object’s attributes.
                  The function deletes the named attribute, provided the
                  object allows it. For example,
                  ``delattr(x, 'foobar')`` is equivalent to
                  ``del x.foobar``.

                  Create a new dictionary. The
                  ```dict`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict>`__
                  object is the dictionary class. See
                  ```dict`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict>`__
                  and `Mapping Types —
                  dict <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping>`__
                  for documentation about this class.

                  For other containers see the built-in
                  ```list`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list>`__,
                  ```set`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set>`__,
                  and
                  ```tuple`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple>`__
                  classes, as well as the
                  ```collections`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections>`__
                  module.

               ``dir``\ ([\ *object*\ ])\ `¶ <#dir>`__
                  Without arguments, return the list of names in the
                  current local scope. With an argument, attempt to
                  return a list of valid attributes for that object.

                  If the object has a method named ``__dir__()``, this
                  method will be called and must return the list of
                  attributes. This allows objects that implement a
                  custom ``__getattr__()`` or ``__getattribute__()``
                  function to customize the way ```dir()`` <#dir>`__
                  reports their attributes.

                  If the object does not provide ``__dir__()``, the
                  function tries its best to gather information from the
                  object’s
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute, if defined, and from its type object. The
                  resulting list is not necessarily complete and may be
                  inaccurate when the object has a custom
                  ``__getattr__()``.

                  The default ```dir()`` <#dir>`__ mechanism behaves
                  differently with different types of objects, as it
                  attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than
                  complete, information:

                  -  If the object is a module object, the list contains
                     the names of the module’s attributes.

                  -  If the object is a type or class object, the list
                     contains the names of its attributes, and
                     recursively of the attributes of its bases.

                  -  Otherwise, the list contains the object’s
                     attributes’ names, the names of its class’s
                     attributes, and recursively of the attributes of
                     its class’s base classes.

                  The resulting list is sorted alphabetically. For
                  example:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                           ...         return ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']
                           >>> s = Shape()
                           >>> dir(s)
                           ['area', 'location', 'perimeter']

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     Because ```dir()`` <#dir>`__ is supplied primarily
                     as a convenience for use at an interactive prompt,
                     it tries to supply an interesting set of names more
                     than it tries to supply a rigorously or
                     consistently defined set of names, and its detailed
                     behavior may change across releases. For example,
                     metaclass attributes are not in the result list
                     when the argument is a class.

               ``divmod``\ (\ *a*, *b*\ )\ `¶ <#divmod>`__
                  Take two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and return
                  a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and
                  remainder when using integer division. With mixed
                  operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic
                  operators apply. For integers, the result is the same
                  as ``(a // b, a % b)``. For floating point numbers the
                  result is ``(q, a % b)``, where *q* is usually
                  ``math.floor(a / b)`` but may be 1 less than that. In
                  any case ``q * b + a % b`` is very close to *a*, if
                  ``a % b`` is non-zero it has the same sign as *b*, and
                  ``0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b)``.

               ``enumerate``\ (\ *iterable*, *start=0*\ )\ `¶ <#enumerate>`__
                  Return an enumerate object. *iterable* must be a
                  sequence, an
                  `iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator>`__,
                  or some other object which supports iteration. The
                  ```__next__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__>`__
                  method of the iterator returned by
                  ```enumerate()`` <#enumerate>`__ returns a tuple
                  containing a count (from *start* which defaults to 0)
                  and the values obtained from iterating over
                  *iterable*.

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']
                           >>> list(enumerate(seasons))
                           [(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')]
                           >>> list(enumerate(seasons, start=1))
                           [(1, 'Spring'), (2, 'Summer'), (3, 'Fall'), (4, 'Winter')]

                  Equivalent to:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
                               n = start
                               for elem in sequence:
                                   yield n, elem
                                   n += 1

               ``eval``\ (\ *expression*\ [, *globals*\ [, *locals*\ ]])\ `¶ <#eval>`__
                  The arguments are a string and optional globals and
                  locals. If provided, *globals* must be a dictionary.
                  If provided, *locals* can be any mapping object.

                  The *expression* argument is parsed and evaluated as a
                  Python expression (technically speaking, a condition
                  list) using the *globals* and *locals* dictionaries as
                  global and local namespace. If the *globals*
                  dictionary is present and does not contain a value for
                  the key ``__builtins__``, a reference to the
                  dictionary of the built-in module
                  ```builtins`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins>`__
                  is inserted under that key before *expression* is
                  parsed. That way you can control what builtins are
                  available to the executed code by inserting your own
                  ``__builtins__`` dictionary into *globals* before
                  passing it to ```eval()`` <#eval>`__. If the *locals*
                  dictionary is omitted it defaults to the *globals*
                  dictionary. If both dictionaries are omitted, the
                  expression is executed with the *globals* and *locals*
                  in the environment where ```eval()`` <#eval>`__ is
                  called. Note, *eval()* does not have access to the
                  `nested
                  scopes <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-nested-scope>`__
                  (non-locals) in the enclosing environment.

                  The return value is the result of the evaluated
                  expression. Syntax errors are reported as exceptions.
                  Example:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> x = 1
                           >>> eval('x+1')
                           2

                  This function can also be used to execute arbitrary
                  code objects (such as those created by
                  ```compile()`` <#compile>`__). In this case, pass a
                  code object instead of a string. If the code object
                  has been compiled with ``'exec'`` as the *mode*
                  argument, ```eval()`` <#eval>`__'s return value will
                  be ``None``.

                  Hints: dynamic execution of statements is supported by
                  the ```exec()`` <#exec>`__ function. The
                  ```globals()`` <#globals>`__ and
                  ```locals()`` <#locals>`__ functions return the
                  current global and local dictionary, respectively,
                  which may be useful to pass around for use by
                  ```eval()`` <#eval>`__ or ```exec()`` <#exec>`__.

                  If the given source is a string, then leading and
                  trailing spaces and tabs are stripped.

                  See
                  ```ast.literal_eval()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval>`__
                  for a function that can safely evaluate strings with
                  expressions containing only literals.

                  Raises an `auditing
                  event <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing>`__
                  ``exec`` with the code object as the argument. Code
                  compilation events may also be raised.

               ``exec``\ (\ *object*\ [, *globals*\ [, *locals*\ ]])\ `¶ <#exec>`__
                  This function supports dynamic execution of Python
                  code. *object* must be either a string or a code
                  object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a
                  suite of Python statements which is then executed
                  (unless a syntax error occurs). `1 <#id2>`__ If it is
                  a code object, it is simply executed. In all cases,
                  the code that’s executed is expected to be valid as
                  file input (see the section `File
                  input <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/toplevel_components.html#file-input>`__
                  in the Reference Manual). Be aware that the
                  ```nonlocal`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal>`__,
                  ```yield`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#yield>`__,
                  and
                  ```return`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return>`__
                  statements may not be used outside of function
                  definitions even within the context of code passed to
                  the ```exec()`` <#exec>`__ function. The return value
                  is ``None``.

                  In all cases, if the optional parts are omitted, the
                  code is executed in the current scope. If only
                  *globals* is provided, it must be a dictionary (and
                  not a subclass of dictionary), which will be used for
                  both the global and the local variables. If *globals*
                  and *locals* are given, they are used for the global
                  and local variables, respectively. If provided,
                  *locals* can be any mapping object. Remember that at
                  the module level, globals and locals are the same
                  dictionary. If exec gets two separate objects as
                  *globals* and *locals*, the code will be executed as
                  if it were embedded in a class definition.

                  If the *globals* dictionary does not contain a value
                  for the key ``__builtins__``, a reference to the
                  dictionary of the built-in module
                  ```builtins`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins>`__
                  is inserted under that key. That way you can control
                  what builtins are available to the executed code by
                  inserting your own ``__builtins__`` dictionary into
                  *globals* before passing it to ```exec()`` <#exec>`__.

                  Raises an `auditing
                  event <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#auditing>`__
                  ``exec`` with the code object as the argument. Code
                  compilation events may also be raised.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     The built-in functions ```globals()`` <#globals>`__
                     and ```locals()`` <#locals>`__ return the current
                     global and local dictionary, respectively, which
                     may be useful to pass around for use as the second
                     and third argument to ```exec()`` <#exec>`__.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     The default *locals* act as described for function
                     ```locals()`` <#locals>`__ below: modifications to
                     the default *locals* dictionary should not be
                     attempted. Pass an explicit *locals* dictionary if
                     you need to see effects of the code on *locals*
                     after function ```exec()`` <#exec>`__ returns.

               ``filter``\ (\ *function*, *iterable*\ )\ `¶ <#filter>`__
                  Construct an iterator from those elements of
                  *iterable* for which *function* returns true.
                  *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container which
                  supports iteration, or an iterator. If *function* is
                  ``None``, the identity function is assumed, that is,
                  all elements of *iterable* that are false are removed.

                  Note that ``filter(function, iterable)`` is equivalent
                  to the generator expression
                  ``(item for item in iterable if function(item))`` if
                  function is not ``None`` and
                  ``(item for item in iterable if item)`` if function is
                  ``None``.

                  for the complementary function that returns elements
                  of *iterable* for which *function* returns false.

               *class* ``float``\ ([\ *x*\ ])\ `¶ <#float>`__
                  Return a floating point number constructed from a
                  number or string *x*.

                  If the argument is a string, it should contain a
                  decimal number, optionally preceded by a sign, and
                  optionally embedded in whitespace. The optional sign
                  may be ``'+'`` or ``'-'``; a ``'+'`` sign has no
                  effect on the value produced. The argument may also be
                  a string representing a NaN (not-a-number), or
                  positive or negative infinity. More precisely, the
                  input must conform to the following grammar after
                  leading and trailing whitespace characters are
                  removed:

                  ::

                     sign           ::=  "+" | "-"
                     infinity       ::=  "Infinity" | "inf"
                     nan            ::=  "nan"
                     numeric_value  ::=  floatnumber | infinity | nan
                     numeric_string ::=  [sign] numeric_value

                  Here ``floatnumber`` is the form of a Python
                  floating-point literal, described in `Floating point
                  literals <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating>`__.
                  Case is not significant, so, for example, “inf”,
                  “Inf”, “INFINITY”, and “iNfINity” are all acceptable
                  spellings for positive infinity.

                  Otherwise, if the argument is an integer or a floating
                  point number, a floating point number with the same
                  value (within Python’s floating point precision) is
                  returned. If the argument is outside the range of a
                  Python float, an
                  ```OverflowError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError>`__
                  will be raised.

                  For a general Python object ``x``, ``float(x)``
                  delegates to ``x.__float__()``. If ``__float__()`` is
                  not defined then it falls back to ``__index__()``.

                  If no argument is given, ``0.0`` is returned.

                  Examples:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> float('+1.23')
                           1.23
                           >>> float('   -12345\n')
                           -12345.0
                           >>> float('1e-003')
                           0.001
                           >>> float('+1E6')
                           1000000.0
                           >>> float('-Infinity')
                           -inf

                  The float type is described in `Numeric Types — int,
                  float,
                  complex <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.6:Grouping digits with

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.7:\ *x* is now a
                     positional-only parameter.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.8:Falls back to

               ``format``\ (\ *value*\ [, *format_spec*\ ])\ `¶ <#format>`__
                  Convert a *value* to a “formatted” representation, as
                  controlled by *format_spec*. The interpretation of
                  *format_spec* will depend on the type of the *value*
                  argument; however, there is a standard formatting
                  syntax that is used by most built-in types: `Format
                  Specification
                  Mini-Language <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec>`__.

                  The default *format_spec* is an empty string which
                  usually gives the same effect as calling
                  ```str(value)`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str>`__.

                  A call to ``format(value, format_spec)`` is translated
                  to ``type(value).__format__(value, format_spec)``
                  which bypasses the instance dictionary when searching
                  for the value’s ``__format__()`` method. A
                  ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                  exception is raised if the method search reaches
                  ```object`` <#object>`__ and the *format_spec* is
                  non-empty, or if either the *format_spec* or the
                  return value are not strings.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version
                     3.4:\ ``object().__format__(format_spec)`` raises
                     ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                     if *format_spec* is not an empty string.

               *class* ``frozenset``\ ([\ *iterable*\ ])
                  Return a new
                  ```frozenset`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset>`__
                  object, optionally with elements taken from
                  *iterable*. ``frozenset`` is a built-in class. See
                  ```frozenset`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset>`__
                  and `Set Types — set,
                  frozenset <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set>`__
                  for documentation about this class.

                  For other containers see the built-in

                  module.

               ``getattr``\ (\ *object*, *name*\ [, *default*\ ])\ `¶ <#getattr>`__
                  Return the value of the named attribute of *object*.
                  *name* must be a string. If the string is the name of
                  one of the object’s attributes, the result is the
                  value of that attribute. For example,
                  ``getattr(x, 'foobar')`` is equivalent to
                  ``x.foobar``. If the named attribute does not exist,
                  *default* is returned if provided, otherwise
                  ```AttributeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError>`__
                  is raised.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     Since `private name
                     mangling <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#private-name-mangling>`__
                     happens at compilation time, one must manually
                     mangle a private attribute’s (attributes with two
                     leading underscores) name in order to retrieve it
                     with ```getattr()`` <#getattr>`__.

               ``globals``\ ()\ `¶ <#globals>`__
                  Return the dictionary implementing the current module
                  namespace. For code within functions, this is set when
                  the function is defined and remains the same
                  regardless of where the function is called.

               ``hasattr``\ (\ *object*, *name*\ )\ `¶ <#hasattr>`__
                  The arguments are an object and a string. The result
                  is ``True`` if the string is the name of one of the
                  object’s attributes, ``False`` if not. (This is
                  implemented by calling ``getattr(object, name)`` and
                  seeing whether it raises an
                  ```AttributeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError>`__
                  or not.)

               ``hash``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#hash>`__
                  Return the hash value of the object (if it has one).
                  Hash values are integers. They are used to quickly
                  compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.
                  Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash
                  value (even if they are of different types, as is the
                  case for 1 and 1.0).

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     For objects with custom ``__hash__()`` methods,
                     note that ```hash()`` <#hash>`__ truncates the
                     return value based on the bit width of the host
                     machine. See ``__hash__()`` for details.

               ``help``\ ([\ *object*\ ])\ `¶ <#help>`__
                  Invoke the built-in help system. (This function is
                  intended for interactive use.) If no argument is
                  given, the interactive help system starts on the
                  interpreter console. If the argument is a string, then
                  the string is looked up as the name of a module,
                  function, class, method, keyword, or documentation
                  topic, and a help page is printed on the console. If
                  the argument is any other kind of object, a help page
                  on the object is generated.

                  Note that if a slash(/) appears in the parameter list
                  of a function when invoking ```help()`` <#help>`__, it
                  means that the parameters prior to the slash are
                  positional-only. For more info, see `the FAQ entry on
                  positional-only
                  parameters <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#faq-positional-only-arguments>`__.

                  This function is added to the built-in namespace by
                  the
                  ```site`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site>`__

                     mean that the reported signatures for callables are
                     now more comprehensive and consistent.

               ``hex``\ (\ *x*\ )\ `¶ <#hex>`__
                  Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal
                  string prefixed with “0x”. If *x* is not a Python
                  ```int`` <#int>`__ object, it has to define an
                  ``__index__()`` method that returns an integer. Some
                  examples:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>

                           '-0x2a'

                  If you want to convert an integer number to an
                  uppercase or lower hexadecimal string with prefix or
                  not, you can use either of the following ways:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> '%#x' % 255, '%x' % 255, '%X' % 255
                           ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF')
                           >>> format(255, '#x'), format(255, 'x'), format(255, 'X')
                           ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF')
                           >>> f'{255:#x}', f'{255:x}', f'{255:X}'
                           ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF')

                  See also ```format()`` <#format>`__ for more
                  information.

                  See also ```int()`` <#int>`__ for converting a
                  hexadecimal string to an integer using a base of 16.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     To obtain a hexadecimal string representation for a
                     float, use the
                     ```float.hex()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#float.hex>`__
                     method.

               ``id``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#id>`__
                  Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer
                  which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this
                  object during its lifetime. Two objects with
                  non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same
                  ```id()`` <#id>`__ value.

                  .. container:: impl-detail compound

                     **CPython implementation detail:** This is the
                     address of the object in memory.

                  ``builtins.id`` with argument ``id``.

               ``input``\ ([\ *prompt*\ ])\ `¶ <#input>`__
                  If the *prompt* argument is present, it is written to
                  standard output without a trailing newline. The
                  function then reads a line from input, converts it to
                  a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns
                  that. When EOF is read,
                  ```EOFError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError>`__

               *class* ``int``\ (\ *x*, *base=10*\ )
                  Return an integer object constructed from a number or

                  If *x* defines ``__int__()``, ``int(x)`` returns
                  ``x.__int__()``. If *x* defines ``__index__()``, it
                  returns ``x.__index__()``. If *x* defines
                  ``__trunc__()``, it returns ``x.__trunc__()``. For
                  floating point numbers, this truncates towards zero.

                  If *x* is not a number or if *base* is given, then *x*
                  must be a string,
                  ```bytes`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes>`__,
                  or
                  ```bytearray`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray>`__
                  instance representing an `integer
                  literal <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integers>`__
                  in radix *base*. Optionally, the literal can be
                  preceded by ``+`` or ``-`` (with no space in between)
                  and surrounded by whitespace. A base-n literal
                  consists of the digits 0 to n-1, with ``a`` to ``z``
                  (or ``A`` to ``Z``) having values 10 to 35. The
                  default *base* is 10. The allowed values are 0 and
                  2–36. Base-2, -8, and -16 literals can be optionally
                  prefixed with ``0b``/``0B``, ``0o``/``0O``, or
                  ``0x``/``0X``, as with integer literals in code. Base
                  0 means to interpret exactly as a code literal, so
                  that the actual base is 2, 8, 10, or 16, and so that
                  ``int('010', 0)`` is not legal, while ``int('010')``
                  is, as well as ``int('010', 8)``.

                  The integer type is described in `Numeric Types — int,
                  float,
                  complex <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>`__.

               ``isinstance``\ (\ *object*, *classinfo*\ )\ `¶ <#isinstance>`__

                  subclass thereof. If *object* is not an object of the
                  given type, the function always returns ``False``. If

                  of multiple types, return ``True`` if *object* is an
                  instance of any of the types. If *classinfo* is not a
                  type or tuple of types and such tuples, a
                  ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                  exception is raised.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.10:\ *classinfo* can be a

                  of *classinfo*. A class is considered a subclass of
                  itself. *classinfo* may be a tuple of class objects

                  ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                  exception is raised.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.10:\ *classinfo* can be a

               ``iter``\ (\ *object*\ [, *sentinel*\ ])\ `¶ <#iter>`__
                  Return an
                  `iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator>`__
                  object. The first argument is interpreted very
                  differently depending on the presence of the second
                  argument. Without a second argument, *object* must be
                  a collection object which supports the
                  `iterable <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable>`__
                  protocol (the ``__iter__()`` method), or it must
                  support the sequence protocol (the ``__getitem__()``
                  method with integer arguments starting at ``0``). If
                  it does not support either of those protocols,
                  ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                  is raised. If the second argument, *sentinel*, is
                  given, then *object* must be a callable object. The
                  iterator created in this case will call *object* with
                  no arguments for each call to its
                  ```__next__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__>`__
                  method; if the value returned is equal to *sentinel*,
                  ```StopIteration`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration>`__
                  will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned.

                  See also `Iterator
                  Types <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter>`__.

                  One useful application of the second form of
                  ```iter()`` <#iter>`__ is to build a block-reader. For
                  example, reading fixed-width blocks from a binary
                  database file until the end of file is reached:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           from functools import partial
                           with open('mydata.db', 'rb') as f:
                               for block in iter(partial(f.read, 64), b''):
                                   process_block(block)

               ``len``\ (\ *s*\ )\ `¶ <#len>`__
                  Return the length (the number of items) of an object.
                  The argument may be a sequence (such as a string,
                  bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as
                  a dictionary, set, or frozen set).

                  .. container:: impl-detail compound

                     **CPython implementation detail:** ``len`` raises
                     ```OverflowError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError>`__
                     on lengths larger than
                     ```sys.maxsize`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize>`__,
                     such as

               *class* ``list``\ ([\ *iterable*\ ])
                  Rather than being a function,
                  ```list`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list>`__
                  is actually a mutable sequence type, as documented in
                  `Lists <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-list>`__
                  and `Sequence Types — list, tuple,

               ``locals``\ ()\ `¶ <#locals>`__
                  Update and return a dictionary representing the
                  current local symbol table. Free variables are
                  returned by ```locals()`` <#locals>`__ when it is
                  called in function blocks, but not in class blocks.
                  Note that at the module level,
                  ```locals()`` <#locals>`__ and
                  ```globals()`` <#globals>`__ are the same dictionary.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     The contents of this dictionary should not be
                     modified; changes may not affect the values of
                     local and free variables used by the interpreter.

               ``map``\ (\ *function*, *iterable*, *...*\ )\ `¶ <#map>`__
                  Return an iterator that applies *function* to every
                  item of *iterable*, yielding the results. If
                  additional *iterable* arguments are passed, *function*
                  must take that many arguments and is applied to the
                  items from all iterables in parallel. With multiple
                  iterables, the iterator stops when the shortest
                  iterable is exhausted. For cases where the function
                  inputs are already arranged into argument tuples, see
                  ```itertools.starmap()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.starmap>`__.

               ``max``\ (\ *iterable*, *\**\ [, *key*, *default*\ ])\ `¶ <#max>`__
               ``max``\ (\ *arg1*, *arg2*, *\*args*\ [, *key*\ ])
                  Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest
                  of two or more arguments.

                  If one positional argument is provided, it should be
                  an
                  `iterable <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable>`__.
                  The largest item in the iterable is returned. If two
                  or more positional arguments are provided, the largest
                  of the positional arguments is returned.

                  There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The
                  *key* argument specifies a one-argument ordering
                  function like that used for
                  ```list.sort()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort>`__.
                  The *default* argument specifies an object to return
                  if the provided iterable is empty. If the iterable is
                  empty and *default* is not provided, a
                  ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                  is raised.

                  If multiple items are maximal, the function returns
                  the first one encountered. This is consistent with
                  other sort-stability preserving tools such as
                  ``sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0]`` and
                  ``heapq.nlargest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc)``.

               *class* ``memoryview``\ (\ *object*\ )
                  Return a “memory view” object created from the given
                  argument. See `Memory
                  Views <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typememoryview>`__

               ``min``\ (\ *arg1*, *arg2*, *\*args*\ [, *key*\ ])
                  Return the smallest item in an iterable or the
                  smallest of two or more arguments.

                  If one positional argument is provided, it should be
                  an
                  `iterable <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable>`__.
                  The smallest item in the iterable is returned. If two
                  or more positional arguments are provided, the
                  smallest of the positional arguments is returned.

                  There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The
                  *key* argument specifies a one-argument ordering
                  function like that used for
                  ```list.sort()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort>`__.
                  The *default* argument specifies an object to return
                  if the provided iterable is empty. If the iterable is
                  empty and *default* is not provided, a
                  ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                  is raised.

                  If multiple items are minimal, the function returns
                  the first one encountered. This is consistent with
                  other sort-stability preserving tools such as
                  ``sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc)[0]`` and
                  ``heapq.nsmallest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc)``.

               ``next``\ (\ *iterator*\ [, *default*\ ])\ `¶ <#next>`__
                  Retrieve the next item from the
                  `iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator>`__
                  by calling its

                  method. If *default* is given, it is returned if the

                  ```StopIteration`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration>`__

               *class* ``object``\ `¶ <#object>`__
                  Return a new featureless object.
                  ```object`` <#object>`__ is a base for all classes. It
                  has methods that are common to all instances of Python
                  classes. This function does not accept any arguments.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     ```object`` <#object>`__ does *not* have a
                     ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__,
                     so you can’t assign arbitrary attributes to an
                     instance of the ```object`` <#object>`__ class.

               ``oct``\ (\ *x*\ )\ `¶ <#oct>`__
                  Convert an integer number to an octal string prefixed
                  with “0o”. The result is a valid Python expression. If
                  *x* is not a Python ```int`` <#int>`__ object, it has
                  to define an ``__index__()`` method that returns an
                  integer. For example:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>

                           '-0o70'

                  If you want to convert an integer number to an octal
                  string either with the prefix “0o” or not, you can use
                  either of the following ways.

                  object <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object>`__.
                  If the file cannot be opened, an
                  ```OSError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError>`__
                  is raised. See `Reading and Writing

                  for more examples of how to use this function.

                  *file* is a `path-like
                  object <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object>`__
                  giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the
                  current working directory) of the file to be opened or
                  an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped.
                  (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
                  returned I/O object is closed unless *closefd* is set
                  to ``False``.)

                  *mode* is an optional string that specifies the mode
                  in which the file is opened. It defaults to ``'r'``
                  which means open for reading in text mode. Other
                  common values are ``'w'`` for writing (truncating the
                  file if it already exists), ``'x'`` for exclusive
                  creation, and ``'a'`` for appending (which on *some*
                  Unix systems, means that *all* writes append to the
                  end of the file regardless of the current seek
                  position). In text mode, if *encoding* is not
                  specified the encoding used is platform-dependent:
                  ``locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`` is called to
                  get the current locale encoding. (For reading and
                  writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave *encoding*
                  unspecified.) The available modes are:

                  The default mode is ``'r'`` (open for reading text, a
                  synonym of ``'rt'``). Modes ``'w+'`` and ``'w+b'``
                  open and truncate the file. Modes ``'r+'`` and
                  ``'r+b'`` open the file with no truncation.

                  As mentioned in the
                  `Overview <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io-overview>`__,
                  Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O.
                  Files opened in binary mode (including ``'b'`` in the
                  *mode* argument) return contents as
                  ```bytes`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes>`__
                  objects without any decoding. In text mode (the
                  default, or when ``'t'`` is included in the *mode*
                  argument), the contents of the file are returned as
                  ```str`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str>`__,
                  the bytes having been first decoded using a
                  platform-dependent encoding or using the specified
                  *encoding* if given.

                  There is an additional mode character permitted,
                  ``'U'``, which no longer has any effect, and is
                  considered deprecated. It previously enabled
                  `universal
                  newlines <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines>`__
                  in text mode, which became the default behavior in
                  Python 3.0. Refer to the documentation of the
                  `newline <#open-newline-parameter>`__ parameter for
                  further details.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating
                     system’s notion of text files; all the processing
                     is done by Python itself, and is therefore
                     platform-independent.

                  *buffering* is an optional integer used to set the
                  buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only
                  allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering
                  (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to
                  indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk
                  buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way
                  applies for binary buffered I/O, but ``TextIOWrapper``
                  (i.e., files opened with ``mode='r+'``) would have
                  another buffering. To disable buffering in
                  ``TextIOWrapper``, consider using the
                  ``write_through`` flag for
                  ```io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure>`__.
                  When no *buffering* argument is given, the default
                  buffering policy works as follows:

                  -  Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the
                     size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic
                     trying to determine the underlying device’s “block
                     size” and falling back on
                     ```io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE>`__.
                     On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096
                     or 8192 bytes long.

                  -  “Interactive” text files (files for which
                     ```isatty()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.isatty>`__
                     returns ``True``) use line buffering. Other text
                     files use the policy described above for binary
                     files.

                  *encoding* is the name of the encoding used to decode
                  or encode the file. This should only be used in text
                  mode. The default encoding is platform dependent
                  (whatever
                  ```locale.getpreferredencoding()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getpreferredencoding>`__
                  returns), but any `text
                  encoding <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-encoding>`__
                  supported by Python can be used. See the
                  ```codecs`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs>`__
                  module for the list of supported encodings.

                  *errors* is an optional string that specifies how
                  encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this
                  cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard
                  error handlers are available (listed under `Error
                  Handlers <https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#error-handlers>`__),
                  though any error handling name that has been
                  registered with
                  ```codecs.register_error()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.register_error>`__
                  is also valid. The standard names include:

                  -  ``'strict'`` to raise a
                     ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                     exception if there is an encoding error. The
                     default value of ``None`` has the same effect.

                  -  ``'ignore'`` ignores errors. Note that ignoring
                     encoding errors can lead to data loss.

                  -  ``'replace'`` causes a replacement marker (such as
                     ``'?'``) to be inserted where there is malformed
                     data.

                  -  ``'surrogateescape'`` will represent any incorrect
                     bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from
                     U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will
                     then be turned back into the same bytes when the
                     ``surrogateescape`` error handler is used when
                     writing data. This is useful for processing files
                     in an unknown encoding.

                  -  ``'xmlcharrefreplace'`` is only supported when
                     writing to a file. Characters not supported by the
                     encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML
                     character reference ``&#nnn;``.

                  -  ``'backslashreplace'`` replaces malformed data by
                     Python’s backslashed escape sequences.

                  -  ``'namereplace'`` (also only supported when
                     writing) replaces unsupported characters with
                     ``\N{...}`` escape sequences.

                  *newline* controls how `universal
                  newlines <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines>`__
                  mode works (it only applies to text mode). It can be
                  ``None``, ``''``, ``'\n'``, ``'\r'``, and ``'\r\n'``.
                  It works as follows:

                  -  When reading input from the stream, if *newline* is
                     ``None``, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines
                     in the input can end in ``'\n'``, ``'\r'``, or
                     ``'\r\n'``, and these are translated into ``'\n'``
                     before being returned to the caller. If it is
                     ``''``, universal newlines mode is enabled, but
                     line endings are returned to the caller
                     untranslated. If it has any of the other legal
                     values, input lines are only terminated by the
                     given string, and the line ending is returned to
                     the caller untranslated.

                  -  When writing output to the stream, if *newline* is
                     ``None``, any ``'\n'`` characters written are
                     translated to the system default line separator,
                     ```os.linesep`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.linesep>`__.
                     If *newline* is ``''`` or ``'\n'``, no translation
                     takes place. If *newline* is any of the other legal
                     values, any ``'\n'`` characters written are
                     translated to the given string.

                  If *closefd* is ``False`` and a file descriptor rather
                  than a filename was given, the underlying file
                  descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed.
                  If a filename is given *closefd* must be ``True`` (the
                  default); otherwise, an error will be raised.

                  A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as
                  *opener*. The underlying file descriptor for the file
                  object is then obtained by calling *opener* with
                  (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open file
                  descriptor (passing
                  ```os.open`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open>`__
                  as *opener* results in functionality similar to
                  passing ``None``).

                  The newly created file is
                  `non-inheritable <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#fd-inheritance>`__.

                  The following example uses the
                  `dir_fd <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#dir-fd>`__
                  parameter of the
                  ```os.open()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.open>`__
                  function to open a file relative to a given directory:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                           >>> import os
                           >>> dir_fd = os.open('somedir', os.O_RDONLY)
                           >>> def opener(path, flags):

                  The type of `file
                  object <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object>`__
                  returned by the ```open()`` <#open>`__ function
                  depends on the mode. When ```open()`` <#open>`__ is
                  used to open a file in a text mode (``'w'``, ``'r'``,
                  ``'wt'``, ``'rt'``, etc.), it returns a subclass of
                  ```io.TextIOBase`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase>`__
                  (specifically
                  ```io.TextIOWrapper`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper>`__).
                  When used to open a file in a binary mode with
                  buffering, the returned class is a subclass of
                  ```io.BufferedIOBase`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase>`__.
                  The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it
                  returns an
                  ```io.BufferedReader`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader>`__;
                  in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an
                  ```io.BufferedWriter`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedWriter>`__,
                  and in read/write mode, it returns an
                  ```io.BufferedRandom`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedRandom>`__.
                  When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass
                  of
                  ```io.RawIOBase`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase>`__,
                  ```io.FileIO`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.FileIO>`__,
                  is returned.

                           Changed in version 3.3:

                           -  The *opener* parameter was added.

                           -  The ``'x'`` mode was added.

                              used to be raised, it is now an alias of

                           -  ```FileExistsError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileExistsError>`__
                              is now raised if the file opened in
                              exclusive creation mode (``'x'``) already
                              exists.

                        .. container::

                           Changed in version 3.5:

                           -  If the system call is interrupted and the
                              signal handler does not raise an
                              exception, the function now retries the
                              system call instead of raising an
                              ```InterruptedError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#InterruptedError>`__
                              exception (see `PEP

                              for the rationale).

                           -  The ``'namereplace'`` error handler was
                              added.

                        .. container::

                           Changed in version 3.6:

                           -  Support added to accept objects
                              implementing
                              ```os.PathLike`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike>`__.

                           -  On Windows, opening a console buffer may
                              return a subclass of
                              ```io.RawIOBase`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase>`__
                              other than
                              ```io.FileIO`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.FileIO>`__.

               ``ord``\ (\ *c*\ )\ `¶ <#ord>`__
                  Given a string representing one Unicode character,
                  return an integer representing the Unicode code point
                  of that character. For example, ``ord('a')`` returns
                  the integer ``97`` and ``ord('€')`` (Euro sign)
                  returns ``8364``. This is the inverse of
                  ```chr()`` <#chr>`__.

               ``pow``\ (\ *base*, *exp*\ [, *mod*\ ])\ `¶ <#pow>`__
                  Return *base* to the power *exp*; if *mod* is present,
                  return *base* to the power *exp*, modulo *mod*
                  (computed more efficiently than
                  ``pow(base, exp) % mod``). The two-argument form
                  ``pow(base, exp)`` is equivalent to using the power
                  operator: ``base**exp``.

                  The arguments must have numeric types. With mixed
                  operand types, the coercion rules for binary
                  arithmetic operators apply. For ```int`` <#int>`__
                  operands, the result has the same type as the operands
                  (after coercion) unless the second argument is
                  negative; in that case, all arguments are converted to
                  float and a float result is delivered. For example,
                  ``pow(10, 2)`` returns ``100``, but ``pow(10, -2)``
                  returns ``0.01``. For a negative base of type
                  ```int`` <#int>`__ or ```float`` <#float>`__ and a
                  non-integral exponent, a complex result is delivered.
                  For example, ``pow(-9, 0.5)`` returns a value close to
                  ``3j``.

                  For ```int`` <#int>`__ operands *base* and *exp*, if
                  *mod* is present, *mod* must also be of integer type
                  and *mod* must be nonzero. If *mod* is present and
                  *exp* is negative, *base* must be relatively prime to
                  *mod*. In that case, ``pow(inv_base, -exp, mod)`` is
                  returned, where *inv_base* is an inverse to *base*
                  modulo *mod*.

                  Here’s an example of computing an inverse for ``38``
                  modulo ``97``:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> pow(38, -1, mod=97)
                           23
                           >>> 23 * 38 % 97 == 1
                           True

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.8:For ```int`` <#int>`__
                     operands, the three-argument form of ``pow`` now
                     allows the second argument to be negative,
                     permitting computation of modular inverses.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.8:Allow keyword arguments.
                     Formerly, only positional arguments were supported.

               ``print``\ (\ *\*objects*, *sep=' '*, *end='\n'*, *file=sys.stdout*, *flush=False*\ )\ `¶ <#print>`__
                  Print *objects* to the text stream *file*, separated
                  by *sep* and followed by *end*. *sep*, *end*, *file*,
                  and *flush*, if present, must be given as keyword
                  arguments.

                  All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings
                  like
                  ```str()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str>`__
                  does and written to the stream, separated by *sep* and
                  followed by *end*. Both *sep* and *end* must be
                  strings; they can also be ``None``, which means to use
                  the default values. If no *objects* are given,
                  ```print()`` <#print>`__ will just write *end*.

                  The *file* argument must be an object with a
                  ``write(string)`` method; if it is not present or
                  ``None``,
                  ```sys.stdout`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout>`__
                  will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to
                  text strings, ```print()`` <#print>`__ cannot be used
                  with binary mode file objects. For these, use
                  ``file.write(...)`` instead.

                  Whether the output is buffered is usually determined
                  by *file*, but if the *flush* keyword argument is
                  true, the stream is forcibly flushed.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.3:Added the *flush* keyword
                     argument.

               *class* ``property``\ (\ *fget=None*, *fset=None*, *fdel=None*, *doc=None*\ )\ `¶ <#property>`__
                  Return a property attribute.

                  *fget* is a function for getting an attribute value.
                  *fset* is a function for setting an attribute value.
                  *fdel* is a function for deleting an attribute value.
                  And *doc* creates a docstring for the attribute.

                  A typical use is to define a managed attribute ``x``:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class C:
                               def __init__(self):
                                   self._x = None

                               def getx(self):
                                   return self._x

                               def setx(self, value):
                                   self._x = value

                               def delx(self):
                                   del self._x

                               x = property(getx, setx, delx, "I'm the 'x' property.")

                  If *c* is an instance of *C*, ``c.x`` will invoke the
                  getter, ``c.x = value`` will invoke the setter, and
                  ``del c.x`` the deleter.

                  If given, *doc* will be the docstring of the property
                  attribute. Otherwise, the property will copy
                  *fget*\ ’s docstring (if it exists). This makes it
                  possible to create read-only properties easily using
                  ```property()`` <#property>`__ as a
                  `decorator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator>`__:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class Parrot:
                               def __init__(self):
                                   self._voltage = 100000

                               @property
                               def voltage(self):
                                   """Get the current voltage."""
                                   return self._voltage

                  The ``@property`` decorator turns the ``voltage()``
                  method into a “getter” for a read-only attribute with
                  the same name, and it sets the docstring for *voltage*
                  to “Get the current voltage.”

                  A property object has ``getter``, ``setter``, and
                  ``deleter`` methods usable as decorators that create a
                  copy of the property with the corresponding accessor
                  function set to the decorated function. This is best
                  explained with an example:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class C:
                               def __init__(self):
                                   self._x = None

                               @property
                               def x(self):
                                   """I'm the 'x' property."""
                                   return self._x

                               @x.setter
                               def x(self, value):
                                   self._x = value

                               @x.deleter
                               def x(self):
                                   del self._x

                  This code is exactly equivalent to the first example.
                  Be sure to give the additional functions the same name
                  as the original property (``x`` in this case.)

                  The returned property object also has the attributes
                  ``fget``, ``fset``, and ``fdel`` corresponding to the
                  constructor arguments.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.5:The docstrings of property
                     objects are now writeable.

               *class* ``range``\ (\ *stop*\ )
               *class* ``range``\ (\ *start*, *stop*\ [, *step*\ ])
                  Rather than being a function,
                  ```range`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range>`__
                  is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented
                  in
                  `Ranges <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range>`__
                  and `Sequence Types — list, tuple,
                  range <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq>`__.

               ``repr``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#repr>`__
                  Return a string containing a printable representation
                  of an object. For many types, this function makes an
                  attempt to return a string that would yield an object
                  with the same value when passed to
                  ```eval()`` <#eval>`__; otherwise, the representation
                  is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains
                  the name of the type of the object together with
                  additional information often including the name and
                  address of the object. A class can control what this
                  function returns for its instances by defining a
                  ``__repr__()`` method.

               ``reversed``\ (\ *seq*\ )\ `¶ <#reversed>`__
                  Return a reverse
                  `iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator>`__.
                  *seq* must be an object which has a ``__reversed__()``
                  method or supports the sequence protocol (the
                  ``__len__()`` method and the ``__getitem__()`` method
                  with integer arguments starting at ``0``).

               ``round``\ (\ *number*\ [, *ndigits*\ ])\ `¶ <#round>`__
                  Return *number* rounded to *ndigits* precision after
                  the decimal point. If *ndigits* is omitted or is
                  ``None``, it returns the nearest integer to its input.

                  For the built-in types supporting
                  ```round()`` <#round>`__, values are rounded to the
                  closest multiple of 10 to the power minus *ndigits*;
                  if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done
                  toward the even choice (so, for example, both
                  ``round(0.5)`` and ``round(-0.5)`` are ``0``, and
                  ``round(1.5)`` is ``2``). Any integer value is valid
                  for *ndigits* (positive, zero, or negative). The
                  return value is an integer if *ndigits* is omitted or
                  ``None``. Otherwise, the return value has the same
                  type as *number*.

                  For a general Python object ``number``, ``round``
                  delegates to ``number.__round__``.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     The behavior of ```round()`` <#round>`__ for floats
                     can be surprising: for example, ``round(2.675, 2)``
                     gives ``2.67`` instead of the expected ``2.68``.
                     This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that
                     most decimal fractions can’t be represented exactly
                     as a float. See `Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues
                     and
                     Limitations <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues>`__
                     for more information.

               *class* ``set``\ ([\ *iterable*\ ])
                  Return a new
                  ```set`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set>`__
                  object, optionally with elements taken from
                  *iterable*. ``set`` is a built-in class. See
                  ```set`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set>`__
                  and `Set Types — set,
                  frozenset <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set>`__
                  for documentation about this class.

                  For other containers see the built-in
                  ```frozenset`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset>`__,
                  ```list`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list>`__,
                  ```tuple`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple>`__,
                  and
                  ```dict`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict>`__
                  classes, as well as the
                  ```collections`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#module-collections>`__
                  module.

               ``setattr``\ (\ *object*, *name*, *value*\ )\ `¶ <#setattr>`__
                  This is the counterpart of
                  ```getattr()`` <#getattr>`__. The arguments are an
                  object, a string, and an arbitrary value. The string
                  may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The
                  function assigns the value to the attribute, provided
                  the object allows it. For example,
                  ``setattr(x, 'foobar', 123)`` is equivalent to
                  ``x.foobar = 123``.

                  .. admonition::

                     Note

                     Since `private name
                     mangling <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#private-name-mangling>`__
                     happens at compilation time, one must manually
                     mangle a private attribute’s (attributes with two
                     leading underscores) name in order to set it with
                     ```setattr()`` <#setattr>`__.

               *class* ``slice``\ (\ *stop*\ )\ `¶ <#slice>`__
               *class* ``slice``\ (\ *start*, *stop*\ [, *step*\ ])
                  Return a
                  `slice <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-slice>`__
                  object representing the set of indices specified by
                  ``range(start, stop, step)``. The *start* and *step*
                  arguments default to ``None``. Slice objects have
                  read-only data attributes ``start``, ``stop``, and
                  ``step`` which merely return the argument values (or
                  their default). They have no other explicit
                  functionality; however, they are used by NumPy and
                  other third-party packages. Slice objects are also
                  generated when extended indexing syntax is used. For
                  example: ``a[start:stop:step]`` or
                  ``a[start:stop, i]``. See
                  ```itertools.islice()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice>`__
                  for an alternate version that returns an iterator.

               ``sorted``\ (\ *iterable*, */*, *\**, *key=None*, *reverse=False*\ )\ `¶ <#sorted>`__
                  Return a new sorted list from the items in *iterable*.

                  Has two optional arguments which must be specified as
                  keyword arguments.

                  *key* specifies a function of one argument that is
                  used to extract a comparison key from each element in
                  *iterable* (for example, ``key=str.lower``). The
                  default value is ``None`` (compare the elements
                  directly).

                  *reverse* is a boolean value. If set to ``True``, then
                  the list elements are sorted as if each comparison
                  were reversed.

                  Use
                  ```functools.cmp_to_key()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key>`__
                  to convert an old-style *cmp* function to a *key*
                  function.

                  The built-in ```sorted()`` <#sorted>`__ function is
                  guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it
                  guarantees not to change the relative order of
                  elements that compare equal — this is helpful for
                  sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by
                  department, then by salary grade).

                  The sort algorithm uses only ``<`` comparisons between
                  items. While defining an
                  ```__lt__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__>`__
                  method will suffice for sorting, `PEP
                  8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`__
                  recommends that all six `rich
                  comparisons <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons>`__
                  be implemented. This will help avoid bugs when using
                  the same data with other ordering tools such as
                  ```max()`` <#max>`__ that rely on a different
                  underlying method. Implementing all six comparisons
                  also helps avoid confusion for mixed type comparisons
                  which can call reflected the
                  ```__gt__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__gt__>`__
                  method.

                  For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see
                  `Sorting HOW
                  TO <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sortinghowto>`__.

               ``@``\ ``staticmethod``\ `¶ <#staticmethod>`__
                  Transform a method into a static method.

                  A static method does not receive an implicit first
                  argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class C:
                               @staticmethod
                               def f(arg1, arg2, ...): ...

                  The ``@staticmethod`` form is a function
                  `decorator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator>`__
                  – see `Function
                  definitions <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function>`__
                  for details.

                  A static method can be called either on the class
                  (such as ``C.f()``) or on an instance (such as
                  ``C().f()``). Moreover, they can be called as regular
                  functions (such as ``f()``).

                  Static methods in Python are similar to those found in
                  Java or C++. Also, see
                  ```classmethod()`` <#classmethod>`__ for a variant
                  that is useful for creating alternate class
                  constructors.

                  Like all decorators, it is also possible to call
                  ``staticmethod`` as a regular function and do
                  something with its result. This is needed in some
                  cases where you need a reference to a function from a
                  class body and you want to avoid the automatic
                  transformation to instance method. For these cases,
                  use this idiom:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           def regular_function():
                               ...

                           class C:
                               method = staticmethod(regular_function)

                  For more information on static methods, see `The
                  standard type
                  hierarchy <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.10:Static methods now inherit
                     the method attributes (``__module__``,
                     ``__name__``, ``__qualname__``, ``__doc__`` and
                     ``__annotations__``), have a new ``__wrapped__``
                     attribute, and are now callable as regular
                     functions.

               *class* ``str``\ (\ *object=''*\ )
               *class* ``str``\ (\ *object=b''*, *encoding='utf-8'*, *errors='strict'*\ )
                  Return a
                  ```str`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str>`__
                  version of *object*. See
                  ```str()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str>`__
                  for details.

                  ``str`` is the built-in string
                  `class <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-class>`__.
                  For general information about strings, see `Text
                  Sequence Type —
                  str <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq>`__.

               ``sum``\ (\ *iterable*, */*, *start=0*\ )\ `¶ <#sum>`__
                  Sums *start* and the items of an *iterable* from left
                  to right and returns the total. The *iterable*\ ’s
                  items are normally numbers, and the start value is not
                  allowed to be a string.

                  For some use cases, there are good alternatives to
                  ```sum()`` <#sum>`__. The preferred, fast way to
                  concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling
                  ``''.join(sequence)``. To add floating point values
                  with extended precision, see
                  ```math.fsum()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.fsum>`__.
                  To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using
                  ```itertools.chain()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.8:The *start* parameter can be
                     specified as a keyword argument.

               *class* ``super``\ ([\ *type*\ [, *object-or-type*\ ]])\ `¶ <#super>`__
                  Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a
                  parent or sibling class of *type*. This is useful for
                  accessing inherited methods that have been overridden
                  in a class.

                  The *object-or-type* determines the `method resolution
                  order <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order>`__
                  to be searched. The search starts from the class right
                  after the *type*.

                  For example, if
                  ```__mro__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__mro__>`__
                  of *object-or-type* is ``D -> B -> C -> A -> object``
                  and the value of *type* is ``B``, then
                  ```super()`` <#super>`__ searches
                  ``C -> A -> object``.

                  The
                  ```__mro__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__mro__>`__
                  attribute of the *object-or-type* lists the method
                  resolution search order used by both
                  ```getattr()`` <#getattr>`__ and
                  ```super()`` <#super>`__. The attribute is dynamic and
                  can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is
                  updated.

                  If the second argument is omitted, the super object
                  returned is unbound. If the second argument is an
                  object, ``isinstance(obj, type)`` must be true. If the
                  second argument is a type, ``issubclass(type2, type)``
                  must be true (this is useful for classmethods).

                  There are two typical use cases for *super*. In a
                  class hierarchy with single inheritance, *super* can
                  be used to refer to parent classes without naming them
                  explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable.
                  This use closely parallels the use of *super* in other
                  programming languages.

                  The second use case is to support cooperative multiple
                  inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This
                  use case is unique to Python and is not found in
                  statically compiled languages or languages that only
                  support single inheritance. This makes it possible to
                  implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base
                  classes implement the same method. Good design
                  dictates that such implementations have the same
                  calling signature in every case (because the order of
                  calls is determined at runtime, because that order
                  adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because
                  that order can include sibling classes that are
                  unknown prior to runtime).

                  For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks
                  like this:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           class C(B):
                               def method(self, arg):
                                   super().method(arg)    # This does the same thing as:
                                                          # super(C, self).method(arg)

                  In addition to method lookups,
                  ```super()`` <#super>`__ also works for attribute
                  lookups. One possible use case for this is calling
                  `descriptors <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-descriptor>`__
                  in a parent or sibling class.

                  Note that ```super()`` <#super>`__ is implemented as
                  part of the binding process for explicit dotted
                  attribute lookups such as
                  ``super().__getitem__(name)``. It does so by
                  implementing its own ``__getattribute__()`` method for
                  searching classes in a predictable order that supports
                  cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly,
                  ```super()`` <#super>`__ is undefined for implicit
                  lookups using statements or operators such as
                  ``super()[name]``.

                  Also note that, aside from the zero argument form,
                  ```super()`` <#super>`__ is not limited to use inside
                  methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments
                  exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero
                  argument form only works inside a class definition, as
                  the compiler fills in the necessary details to
                  correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as
                  accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

                  For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative
                  classes using ```super()`` <#super>`__, see `guide to
                  using

               *class* ``tuple``\ ([\ *iterable*\ ])
                  Rather than being a function,
                  ```tuple`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple>`__
                  is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented
                  in
                  `Tuples <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple>`__
                  and `Sequence Types — list, tuple,
                  range <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq>`__.

               *class* ``type``\ (\ *object*\ )\ `¶ <#type>`__
               *class* ``type``\ (\ *name*, *bases*, *dict*, *\*\*kwds*\ )
                  With one argument, return the type of an *object*. The
                  return value is a type object and generally the same
                  object as returned by
                  ```object.__class__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#instance.__class__>`__.

                  The ```isinstance()`` <#isinstance>`__ built-in
                  function is recommended for testing the type of an
                  object, because it takes subclasses into account.

                  With three arguments, return a new type object. This
                  is essentially a dynamic form of the
                  ```class`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class>`__
                  statement. The *name* string is the class name and
                  becomes the
                  ```__name__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__name__>`__
                  attribute. The *bases* tuple contains the base classes
                  and becomes the
                  ```__bases__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__bases__>`__
                  attribute; if empty, ```object`` <#object>`__, the
                  ultimate base of all classes, is added. The *dict*
                  dictionary contains attribute and method definitions
                  for the class body; it may be copied or wrapped before
                  becoming the
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute. The following two statements create
                  identical ```type`` <#type>`__ objects:

                  .. container:: doctest highlight-default notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> class X:
                           ...     a = 1
                           ...
                           >>> X = type('X', (), dict(a=1))

                  See also `Type
                  Objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-type-objects>`__.

                  Keyword arguments provided to the three argument form
                  are passed to the appropriate metaclass machinery
                  (usually
                  ```__init_subclass__()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init_subclass__>`__)
                  in the same way that keywords in a class definition
                  (besides *metaclass*) would.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.6:Subclasses of
                     ```type`` <#type>`__ which don’t override
                     ``type.__new__`` may no longer use the one-argument
                     form to get the type of an object.

               ``vars``\ ([\ *object*\ ])\ `¶ <#vars>`__
                  Return the
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute for a module, class, instance, or any other
                  object with a
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute.

                  Objects such as modules and instances have an
                  updateable
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute; however, other objects may have write
                  restrictions on their
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attributes (for example, classes use a
                  ```types.MappingProxyType`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.MappingProxyType>`__
                  to prevent direct dictionary updates).

                  Without an argument, ```vars()`` <#vars>`__ acts like
                  ```locals()`` <#locals>`__. Note, the locals
                  dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to
                  the locals dictionary are ignored.

                  A
                  ```TypeError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError>`__
                  exception is raised if an object is specified but it
                  doesn’t have a
                  ```__dict__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__>`__
                  attribute (for example, if its class defines the
                  ```__slots__`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__slots__>`__
                  attribute).

               ``zip``\ (\ *\*iterables*, *strict=False*\ )\ `¶ <#zip>`__
                  Iterate over several iterables in parallel, producing
                  tuples with an item from each one.

                  Example:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        >>>
                        ::

                           >>> for item in zip([1, 2, 3], ['sugar', 'spice', 'everything nice']):
                           ...     print(item)
                           ...
                           (1, 'sugar')
                           (2, 'spice')
                           (3, 'everything nice')

                  More formally: ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ returns an
                  iterator of tuples, where the *i*-th tuple contains
                  the *i*-th element from each of the argument
                  iterables.

                  Another way to think of ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ is that
                  it turns rows into columns, and columns into rows.
                  This is similar to `transposing a
                  matrix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose>`__.

                  ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ is lazy: The elements won’t be
                  processed until the iterable is iterated on, e.g. by a
                  ``for`` loop or by wrapping in a
                  ```list`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list>`__.

                  One thing to consider is that the iterables passed to
                  ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ could have different lengths;
                  sometimes by design, and sometimes because of a bug in
                  the code that prepared these iterables. Python offers
                  three different approaches to dealing with this issue:

                  -  By default, ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ stops when the
                     shortest iterable is exhausted. It will ignore the
                     remaining items in the longer iterables, cutting
                     off the result to the length of the shortest
                     iterable:

                     .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                        .. container:: highlight

                           >>>
                           ::

                              >>> list(zip(range(3), ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum']))
                              [(0, 'fee'), (1, 'fi'), (2, 'fo')]

                  -  ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ is often used in cases where
                     the iterables are assumed to be of equal length. In
                     such cases, it’s recommended to use the
                     ``strict=True`` option. Its output is the same as
                     regular ```zip()`` <#zip>`__:

                     .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                        .. container:: highlight

                           >>>
                           ::

                              >>> list(zip(('a', 'b', 'c'), (1, 2, 3), strict=True))
                              [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

                     Unlike the default behavior, it checks that the
                     lengths of iterables are identical, raising a
                     ```ValueError`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError>`__
                     if they aren’t:

                     .. container::
                     doctest highlight-default notranslate

                        .. container:: highlight

                           >>>
                           ::

                              >>> list(zip(range(3), ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], strict=True))
                              Traceback (most recent call last):
                                ...
                              ValueError: zip() argument 2 is longer than argument 1

                     Without the ``strict=True`` argument, any bug that
                     results in iterables of different lengths will be
                     silenced, possibly manifesting as a hard-to-find
                     bug in another part of the program.

                  -  Shorter iterables can be padded with a constant
                     value to make all the iterables have the same
                     length. This is done by
                     ```itertools.zip_longest()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest>`__.

                  Edge cases: With a single iterable argument,
                  ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ returns an iterator of 1-tuples.
                  With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator.

                  Tips and tricks:

                  -  The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables
                     is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for
                     clustering a data series into n-length groups using
                     ``zip(*[iter(s)]*n, strict=True)``. This repeats
                     the *same* iterator ``n`` times so that each output
                     tuple has the result of ``n`` calls to the
                     iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input
                     into n-length chunks.

                  -  ```zip()`` <#zip>`__ in conjunction with the ``*``
                     operator can be used to unzip a list:

                     .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                        .. container:: highlight

                           >>>
                           ::

                              >>> x = [1, 2, 3]
                              >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
                              >>> list(zip(x, y))
                              [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
                              >>> x2, y2 = zip(*zip(x, y))
                              >>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
                              True

                     Note

                     This is an advanced function that is not needed in
                     everyday Python programming, unlike
                     ```importlib.import_module()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module>`__.

                  This function is invoked by the
                  ```import`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import>`__
                  statement. It can be replaced (by importing the
                  ```builtins`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html#module-builtins>`__
                  module and assigning to ``builtins.__import__``) in
                  order to change semantics of the ``import`` statement,
                  but doing so is **strongly** discouraged as it is
                  usually simpler to use import hooks (see `PEP
                  302 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302>`__) to
                  attain the same goals and does not cause issues with
                  code which assumes the default import implementation
                  is in use. Direct use of
                  ```__import__()`` <#import__>`__ is also discouraged
                  in favor of
                  ```importlib.import_module()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module>`__.

                  The function imports the module *name*, potentially
                  using the given *globals* and *locals* to determine
                  how to interpret the name in a package context. The
                  *fromlist* gives the names of objects or submodules
                  that should be imported from the module given by
                  *name*. The standard implementation does not use its
                  *locals* argument at all and uses its *globals* only
                  to determine the package context of the
                  ```import`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import>`__
                  statement.

                  *level* specifies whether to use absolute or relative
                  imports. ``0`` (the default) means only perform
                  absolute imports. Positive values for *level* indicate
                  the number of parent directories to search relative to
                  the directory of the module calling
                  ```__import__()`` <#import__>`__ (see `PEP
                  328 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328>`__ for
                  the details).

                  When the *name* variable is of the form
                  ``package.module``, normally, the top-level package
                  (the name up till the first dot) is returned, *not*
                  the module named by *name*. However, when a non-empty
                  *fromlist* argument is given, the module named by
                  *name* is returned.

                  For example, the statement ``import spam`` results in
                  bytecode resembling the following code:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           spam = __import__('spam', globals(), locals(), [], 0)

                  The statement ``import spam.ham`` results in this
                  call:

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           spam = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), [], 0)

                  Note how ```__import__()`` <#import__>`__ returns the
                  toplevel module here because this is the object that
                  is bound to a name by the
                  ```import`` <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import>`__
                  statement.

                  On the other hand, the statement
                  ``from spam.ham import eggs, sausage as saus`` results
                  in

                  .. container:: highlight-python3 notranslate

                     .. container:: highlight

                        ::

                           _temp = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), ['eggs', 'sausage'], 0)
                           eggs = _temp.eggs
                           saus = _temp.sausage

                  Here, the ``spam.ham`` module is returned from
                  ```__import__()`` <#import__>`__. From this object,
                  the names to import are retrieved and assigned to
                  their respective names.

                  If you simply want to import a module (potentially
                  within a package) by name, use
                  ```importlib.import_module()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module>`__.

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.3:Negative values for *level*
                     are no longer supported (which also changes the
                     default value to 0).

                  .. container:: versionchanged

                     Changed in version 3.9:When the command line
                     options
                     ```-E`` <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-E>`__
                     or
                     ```-I`` <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-I>`__
                     are being used, the environment variable
                     ```PYTHONCASEOK`` <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONCASEOK>`__
                     is now ignored.
